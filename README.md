The QGIS Resource Sharing allows sharing of resources (currently SVGs, symbols,
styles, color ramps, processing scripts, processing models and R scripts),
and this plugin gives you access to shared collections.

The [documentation](https://qgis-contribution.github.io/QGIS-ResourceSharing/)
explains how to use the plugin and how to share resources.
