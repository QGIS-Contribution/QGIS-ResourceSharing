In the repository, you can share collections. Collection is defined as a set 
of resources that belongs together i.e can be used to create a coherent map 
design or to do a specific task.
 
The items that you can share on the repository are:

Item | Notes
--- | ---
Expressions | JSON files that contain user expressions.
Images | SVG files or other image files that can be used for svg marker or raster fill. Can be referenced from symbols.
Symbols | XML files that can contain marker, line and fill symbols and also colorramps, textformattings and labelsettings.
Styles | In the form of QML file.
Processing scripts | Python processing scripts.
Models | Models for the Graphical modeler.
R scripts | Scripts for running R scripts from the Processing Toolbox in QGIS.

Note that you can actually put other QGIS resources in the repository 
(composer templates or project files), and the will be available to
the user in the collections directory.
But the plugin will not do anything with them.
