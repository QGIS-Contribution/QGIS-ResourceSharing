#### Preparing the Repository
In order for the tools to parse the repository correctly, the
repository must have a certain structure. This is what you need to do:
  
  * Go to
    [this page]({{site.baseurl }}/author/repository-structure.html)
    to get information about the structure.
  * Create correct metadata for the repository (consult
    [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/author/creating-metadata.html)).
  * When you have prepared your repository, you can check if the
    repository is all good by trying it using the file system handler.
    In the plugin, go to the ```Settings``` tab and add a new
    repository pointing to the root of the repository in your local
    file system.
    The repository URL looks like this on Linux:
    ```file:///home/pointing/to/repository_root``` and like this:
    ```file://C:/home/pointing/to/repository_root``` on Windows.

#### Where can you  share it?
These are the options for sharing: on Github, GitLab, Bitbucket (they
need to be public repositories), Gogs (*Go Git Service*), local file
system (if you want to share the collections with your colleagues on
the network), or in your own server with the HTTP(S) protocol.

**Github, GitLab and Bitbucket**

There is nothing complicated here if you are already familiar with
git.
After preparing the repository on your local machine, you can make it
into a git repository as usual. In general, you can do:

```
cd <repository root>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Created a cool repository for cool users."
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
git push origin master
```

Note that you currently need to use the ```master``` branch
for your repository.


**Local File System**

This is even simpler.
After preparing the repository, you can use it right away.
In the ```Settings``` tab, you add a repository with URL pointing to
the repository root in your local machine (absolute path, example:
`file:/home/user/QGIS-collections/mycollection`).
It's as simple as that.
If there is a problem with metadata or other issues when adding the 
repository, you will be told.


**Your Own Server**

This option could be useful in some cases, e.g. if you want to make
private collections available for your customers.
There are some additional requirements that you need to be aware of if
you choose this option:

  * The URL structure of the repository. If your repository URL 
    is ```http://www.mydomain.com/qgisrepository/```, you must make
    the metadata available on:
    ```http://www.mydomain.com/qgisrepository/metadata.ini```
  * Each collection must be zipped.
    The zip file of a collection  must be named
    <name of collection>.zip, and the zip shall combine the
    subdirectories of the collection (one or more of
    `checklists`, `expressions`, `image`, `models`, `processing`,
    `rscripts`, `svg` and `symbol`), in addition to a `preview`
    subdirectory for preview images.

    For example, if you have a collection named ```test_collection```,
    the collection must be present as:
    ```http://www.mydomain.com/qgisrepository/collections/test_collection.zip```,
    and the structure of this zip file must be (only include
    directories that contain resources you would like to share):

            test_collection.zip
            ├── checklists
            ├── expressions
            ├── image
            ├── models
            ├── preview
            ├── processing
            ├── rscripts
            ├── svg
            ├── symbol
    
  
  * Preview images that illustrates the collection should be included.
    If you define preview images for collection ```test_collection```
    in metadata (```preview=preview/prev1.png,prev2.png```), you have
    to place these preview images in the zip-file in a separate
    directory 
    - `preview` is the recommended name for that directory.
    
    An example server directory setup for the repository
    `myfirstrepository` with one collection (`test_collection`)
    that contains resources to share in a lot of resource categories:

    The repository URL to be used when adding the repository (in the
    *QGIS Resource Sharing* plugin):
    
        http://www.mydomain.com/qgisrepository/

You can also use authentication for this repository.
Users can configure authentication details in the plugin, so that they
will be able to fetch the repository and the collections inside.
