The officially approved *QGIS Resource Sharing* repositories and
their collections should be listed in the *Settings* tab when you
have clicked the ***Reload Repositories*** button, as illustrated
in the screenshot below.

![Repositories]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/repositories.png)

You can add other repositories by clicking the ```Add repository...```
button and specify a *Name* for the repository (you are free to call
it whatever you like) and its *URL* (remember to use ``https`` for
github and similar repositories).
If authentication is needed to access the repository, *Add* the
configuration.

![Add repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/settings.png)

If the repository is successfully added, you can now also see its
collections in the ``All collections`` tab and install them from there.

The table below lists the types of repositories that can be added.

Type | URL Example | Description
--- | --- | ---
GitHub |  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Resources.git | Works only for GitHub public repositories
GitLab |  https://gitlab.com/test/MyResources.git | 
Bitbucket |  https://bitbucket.org/gisuser/qgis-style-repo-useful.git | Works only for Bitbucket public repositories
Gogs |  | 
File system | file:///home/gisuser/dev/repositories/qgis_resources | Pointing to the repository root in your local file system 
HTTP(s) with zip collections | https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Resources | Pointing to the base URL of the repository. Metadata must be available, with this URL: http(s)://[base_url]/metadata.ini. The collections should be in http(s)://[base_url]/collections/[collection_name].zip

Adding a repository (and loading one or more of its collections) means that
a copy of the repository will be placed in the local file system
(under ``resource_sharing/repositories`` in the QGIS user directory).
