We are using Jekyll for the documentation (i.e this website).
If you want to contribute to the documentation, it is available in
the ```gh-pages``` branch (the documentation is hosted on
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

The documentation is divided into 3 categories: *for users*,
*for authors* and *for developers*.
To update a particular page, find the markdown file in the ``_posts``
directory.
To make a new page, run
``bin/jekyll-page [page title] [category_code]``.
The category codes are:
 * ``user`` (will be placed in the **For Users** section)
 * ``author`` (**For authors** section)
 * ``dev`` (**For developers** section)

After you make changes to the documentation, please make a PR to the
``gh-pages`` branch in the upstream repository.

Put images in the ```assets``` directory.
To use them in your post, you reference them by writing:
``![alt_text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/[the_image_path])``
(only set the *[alt_text]* and *[the_image_path]* parts).
