Releasing a new version involves an upload to plugins.qgis.org, so in order
to complete the workflow you must have a user with sufficient rights to do
upload.

Follow these steps to release the plugin:

1. Update `metadata.txt`:
   * Change the `version`.  
     Example: ```version=0.11.1``` (for point release 11.1 of version 0).
   * Update the `changelog` (add information about the changes in the new
     version).  
     Example:
     ```
     changelog=
         0.11.0 - Check for missing repository name and URL in directory (#64)
                - Correct link to documentation
     ```
     to mention two changes, and refer issue (or PR) #64.
2. Make sure that the log level (set in *resource_sharing/custom_logging.py*)
   is appropriate for deployment:

   ```logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)```

3. The branch to release should be `master`, so make sure you are on the
   master branch before proceeding to the next step.  
   If you want to release from the `develop` branch, please make a PR
   to the `master` branch first.
4. Run ```make release```.

   This will create a package from the current branch,
   add a GitHub version release tag, and publish the plugin to
   ``plugin.qgis.org``.  
   You will be asked for your ``plugins.qgis.org`` id and password.   
5. Voila, the new version of the plugin should be published!  
   ***Check if you can upgrade the plugin in QGIS without problems***.
6. Make a release on Github and highlight all the new features and fixes of
   the new version.
