# Development environment setup

Clone the repository, then follow these steps. It's strongly recomended to develop into a virtual environment.

```bash
# use the latest pip version
python -m pip install -U pip
# install basic packages
python -m pip install -U -r requirements/base.txt
# install development tools
python -m pip install -U -r requirements/development.txt
# install external dependencies
python -m pip install --no-deps -U -r requirements/embedded.txt -t ext_libs
# install pre-commit to respect common development guidelines
pre-commit install
```
